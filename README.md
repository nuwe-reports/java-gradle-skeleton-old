This is a repository intended to serve as a starting point if you want to bootstrap a project in Java 8 with JUnit 5.2 and Gradle 4.6.

<!-- This repository is a Bootstrap (base / project skeleton) designed for quickly getting started developing a Java application.
Check the [Getting Started](#getting-started) for full details. -->

## Technologies

* Java 8
* Gradle 4.6
* [JUnit 5.2](https://junit.org/junit5/)

## Getting Started

Simply run the tests with: `./gradlew test`

<!--
Within the [Makefile](Makefile) you can handle the entire flow to get everything up & running:

1. Install `make` on your computer, if you do not already have it.
2. Start the application: `make up`
3. Run the application tests: `make test`

As you could see on the [Makefile](Makefile) script and the [Docker-Compose File](docker-compose.yml), the whole API
is containerized with Docker and the API is using the internal DNS to connect with the PostgreSQL instance.

Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/ping` to see that everything is up & running!
